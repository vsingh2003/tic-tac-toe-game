# 🕹️ Python Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## 📌 About this Project  
A simple two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Python. The game runs in the terminal and allows two users to take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid. It was developed using core Python features like lists, loops, conditionals, and functions.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Two-player turn-based gameplay  
- 🎯 Win detection (rows, columns, diagonals)  
- 🔁 Draw detection when all cells are filled  
- 🚫 Prevents moves on already occupied spaces  
- 🧠 Clean and modular logic using functions  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- Basic terminal/console interface

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Managing game states with lists  
- Writing modular code with reusable functions  
- Handling user input and validating moves  
- Implementing game logic for win and draw conditions
